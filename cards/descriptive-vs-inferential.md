## Q: What is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?

## Answer (Technical)

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the features of a specific dataset. Typical techniques include:
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of spread (variance, standard deviation, IQR)
- Frequency counts, histograms, and cross-tabulations

Descriptive statistics do not attempt to make claims beyond the observed data.

Inferential statistics use sample data to make statements or decisions about a broader population. Core methods include:
- Estimation (point estimates and confidence intervals)
- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-squared tests, ANOVA)
- Regression and model-based inference

Inferential methods rely on probability models and assumptions (random sampling, independence, distributional form) to generalize findings and quantify uncertainty.

Key distinction: descriptive = summarize the sample; inferential = draw conclusions about a larger population using the sample.

## Answer (Non-Technical)

Imagine descriptive statistics as taking a detailed photograph of the people you actually measured — it tells you what that group looks like. Inferential statistics is like using that photograph to guess what people in the whole city might be like and saying how confident you are in that guess.

Example:
- Descriptive: "In our survey of 50 users, 60% prefer coffee over tea."
- Inferential: "Based on our sample, we estimate that between 55% and 65% of all users prefer coffee (95% confidence)."
