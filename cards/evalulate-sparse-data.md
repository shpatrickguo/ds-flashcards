## Q: You’re given a dataset with millions of rows but sparse information on user behavior. How would you assess whether the dataset is useful for predictive modeling?

A: I’d start by emphasizing that the size of the dataset doesn’t necessarily mean it’s valuable for prediction. The key question is whether it contains enough signal relative to noise. Here’s how I’d approach it:  

- **Coverage and missingness**: First, I’d check how complete the data is. If most variables are missing or nearly constant across users, then the model won’t learn much.  
- **Feature variability**: I’d look at whether the recorded behaviors actually vary between users. For example, if everyone does the same action, there’s nothing useful to distinguish outcomes.  
- **Relationship to target**: If we have a target variable like churn or purchases, I’d measure correlations or information gain between features and that target. This tells me if any features are predictive.  
- **Quick baseline models**: I’d train a very simple model—like logistic regression or a decision tree—and see whether it performs better than a trivial baseline. That’s a practical way to test for signal.  
- **Business context**: Finally, even small predictive improvements may still matter at scale. For example, in churn prediction, a few percentage points can translate into a large business impact.  

**In short**: I’d check completeness, variability, correlations with the outcome, and test quick baseline models. If the data shows signal beyond chance, then it’s worth building more complex models.
