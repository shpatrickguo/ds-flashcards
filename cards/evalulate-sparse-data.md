## Q: Youâ€™re given a dataset with millions of rows but sparse information on user behavior. How would you assess whether the dataset is useful for predictive modeling?

A: Dataset usefulness depends on whether there is predictive signal, not just size. Key steps include:  

- **Coverage and missingness**: Assess data completeness; near-constant or heavily missing features add little value.  
- **Feature variability**: Ensure user behaviors show meaningful variation rather than uniform actions.  
- **Relationship to target**: Check correlations or information gain between features and target outcomes (e.g., churn, purchases).  
- **Baseline modeling**: Train simple models to test predictive lift over trivial baselines.  
- **Business context**: Small predictive gains may still be valuable when scaled to millions of users.
