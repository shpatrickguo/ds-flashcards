## Q: You’re given a dataset with millions of rows but sparse information on user behavior. How would you assess whether the dataset is useful for predictive modeling?

A: Start by emphasizing that the size of the dataset doesn’t necessarily mean it’s valuable for prediction. The key question is whether it contains enough signal relative to noise. 

- **Coverage and missingness**: First, check how complete the data is. If most variables are missing or nearly constant across users, then the model won’t learn much.  
- **Feature variability**: Look at whether the recorded behaviors actually vary between users. For example, if everyone does the same action, there’s nothing useful to distinguish outcomes.  
- **Relationship to target**: If we have a target variable like churn or purchases, let's measure correlations or information gain between features and that target. This tells me if any features are predictive.  
- **Quick baseline models**: Train a very simple model—like logistic regression or a decision tree—and see whether it performs better than a trivial baseline. That’s a practical way to test for signal.  
- **Business context**: Finally, even small predictive improvements may still matter at scale. For example, in churn prediction, a few percentage points can translate into a large business impact.
